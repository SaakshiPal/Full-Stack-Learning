🌍 How the Web Works (Basic Flow)

1. User enters a **URL** in the browser
2. Browser requests data from a **server**
3. **DNS** converts domain name → IP address
4. Server processes request
5. Server sends response (HTML, CSS, JS, data)
6. Browser renders the website

🔐 **HTTPS** uses SSL/TLS encryption to keep data secure

🖥️ Front-End Development

**What users see and interact with**

Responsibilities

* Page layout
* Design
* Buttons, forms, animations
* User experience (UX)

Technologies

* HTML – structure
* CSS – styling
* JavaScript – interactivity

📌 Example:

* Clicking **“Add to Cart”**
* Cart icon updates instantly

---

⚙️ Back-End Development

**What happens behind the scenes**

Responsibilities

* Authentication (login/signup)
* Business logic
* Database operations
* API handling

### Example:

* Verifying username & password during login



🔄 Full-Stack Development

* Combines **Front-End + Back-End**
* Can build complete applications independently

---

🛠️ Development Tools

* Code Editors (VS Code, etc.)
* Version Control (Git, GitHub)
* Browsers (for testing & debugging)
* Frameworks & Libraries (to speed up development)

---

🔗 Front-End ↔ Back-End Interaction

* User action → request sent to backend
* Backend processes data
* Backend sends response
* Front-end updates UI

📌 Example:

* Add product → backend updates cart → frontend shows new total


🔐 Web Security Basics

* **SSL/TLS** – encrypts data
* **Cookies** – store session info
* **Sessions** – maintain user login
* Security practices:

  * Input validation
  * Secure headers
  * Content Security Policy (CSP)

---

🧩 Core Web Development Terminologies

🔌 API (Application Programming Interface)

* Acts as a **bridge** between systems
* Allows frontend and backend to communicate
* Invisible but powerful

📌 Example:

* Food delivery app uses:

  * Restaurant API
  * Payment API
  * Maps API

---

📦 JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

* Lightweight data format
* Easy to read and write
* Used everywhere in modern web apps

📌 Used for:

* Sending data between frontend & backend

---

🏷️ HTML vs XML

| Feature        | HTML         | XML                    |
| -------------- | ------------ | ---------------------- |
| Purpose        | Display data | Store & transport data |
| Tags           | Predefined   | User-defined           |
| Case-sensitive | ❌ No         | ✅ Yes                  |
| Strict syntax  | ❌ No         | ✅ Yes                  |

📌 HTML → Visual display
📌 XML → Data storage
📌 JSON → Most popular today
